🧬 Align_genes


Welcome to my beginner-level project exploring the core logic behind pairwise and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) — two fundamental concepts in bioinformatics!



In this repository, you’ll find simple, interactive examples using Python and Biopython (run on Google Colab) that demonstrate how biological sequences can be compared, scored, and visualized to reveal similarity and conservation.

📁 What’s Inside
pairwise_sequence_alignment.ipynb

→ Compares two DNA sequences using Biopython’s local alignment (with scoring and alignment output). Includes gap penalties, alignment formatting, and a local alignment score.

multiple_sequence_alignment.ipynb

→ Aligns multiple sequences and highlights conserved positions. Basic visualizations show how sequences change (or don’t) across alignment columns.

🚀 Why This Matters


Sequence alignment isn’t just about comparing letters — it’s how we:

* Study evolution between genes and species

* Detect mutations or conserved motifs

* Design better experiments in molecular biology

* Build the foundation for advanced bioinformatics pipelines



And the best part? Even beginners can do it using open-source tools.
